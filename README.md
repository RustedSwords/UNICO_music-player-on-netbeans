# UNICO_music-player-on-netbeans
A simple java application which was made for the purpose of understanding database connectivity. 
#NOTE
This project was built on netbeans in 2017-18
It works on netbeans 8.2 and I am not quite certain about the version of mysql.
The SQL codes for creating the database are given.
The major thing missing in this project is the songs. I have not uploaded the song directory because of copyright. You can still download your own favourite songs and add them to the directory to test it out.
Please overlook any typos and other syntax errors because it was created during the very initial phase when my team learned java.
